Excitingly, we're developing new products, including Busy Bar, which connects deeply with online services. This growth means that establishing a secure, resilient infrastructure with excellent monitoring is a critical area of focus for us right now.

## Cover Letter:
Woah, I couldn't believe it when I saw this Ad on LinkedIn, I know it's a long shot, but I couldn't be any more excited for a job application.

I've always wanted to have a Flipper Zero, but since I transitioned from Electronic to DevOps Engineer I stoped buying stuff as I had my closet full, and still have, 
of prototype mini computers and microcontrollers as well as all the accessory sensors, shields, custom boards, power supplies and who know what else.

The Flipper Zero was one of the coolest devices I've seen a review of and just to be closer to the team that made it happen is such a thrilling opportunity for learning.

I've always been a hacky guy since my early childhood, I would tear my toys to pieces to build the perfect one. 
On my first year of high school while I was learning color theory I use my train variable transformer to control a DC motor 
I pulled from an electric car to drive a flat disc with the rainbow colors drawn as a pie chart until I found the 
velocity needed to turn it white. None of the other kids could spin it so fast and steady to get the illusion working. 

I have several stories like this, I've rooted my phones, changed the firmware on Sonoffs to connect them to Openhab and 
designed custom shields and sensor to improve what it was on the market or just for fun. I used to fix general appliances 
too but only when it was worth the time, which is almost never.

Please, please consider me for this role, I am much more skillful that I can express in these short words.

## Application requirement review

Below, I detail how my experience with the tools mentioned and particular projects I worked in may help you decide I'm the perfect guy for the job.

**Requirements
Linux – advanced level: architectural knowledge, deployment, debugging
K8S – advanced level: architecture, public and private clouds, networking (including service mesh), debugging
Docker – packaging web services and auxiliary tools
Observability – Monitoring (Zabbix/Nagios, etc), Logging (graylog, logstash, etc), Metrics (Prometheus) Networks – OSI Model, Linux network stack
Python – for practical tasks related to automation of deployment, testing, monitoring**

There are probably some guys better than me to do troubleshooting in these platforms, but I don't think you can find one as easily.
Seriously, my brain is designed for this and my only problem is to let go, so I can eat, sleep and survive while I'm debugging an issue.

**Linux:**
I've worked in Netlabs after being a Datacenter technical leader for IBM just because they were a RedHat partner and known to have the best Linux Sys Admins.
I went from being responsible for two datacenters operations to a Junior Sys Admin just get the best mentors and I did at least for Linux.

Anything from IP tables, SE-Linux, file ACLs, LVM, Firewalls, User management and permissions and file systems, including Ceph, GlusterFS and NFS. 
I've used Apache, Nginx and HA proxy in Linux, Pfsense and LDAP servers.

I'm a little rusty since in the DevOps/Microservices world is not used as much as in old Monolithic applications, 
but still use bash a lot to glue everything together for pipelines.


**K8 and Docker:**
I've put these two together, because I've always used together, I've deployed several type of applications to kubernetes 
including Spring-boot built with Gradle and Maven, also Python applications modules and Node website using Express and Next.

I'm familiar with importance of: 
- Light containers for better resource allocation.
- Propper Liveness and Readiness Checks to improve availability.
- Actuators and likes to publish internal metrics for better monitoring and scaling, horizontally and vertically.
- Managing virtual physical volumes configuration to mange data retention, after deployment deletion for example.
- How to deploy Daemon sets, Stateful Sets, Deployments, Cron Jobs
- How to migrate cluster versions and load to specific node groups
- The difference between Nginx controller form K8s and kubernetes-controller from Nginx
- How to configure Virtual Servers, Virtual Routes, API, Targets, Service Accounts, Secrets, Config Maps, etc.

### Product Developer for Antel NDG


- Designed a multilayer reference architecture for IaaS clients using vCloud Director.
- Managed Linux VM templates using Ansible.
- Managed web access with Apache mod_proxy, pfSense, and vShields.
- **Deployed ELK stack and Zabbix servers using Docker Swarm.**

**Observability:**

I've used all of them, Nagios just to created configured container from exports from linux instances. 
However, I would use Opensearch with OTEL and Data Prepper to substitute of all of them. 
They look old compared to these new tools, and you get a true APM with Metrics, Logging and Traces for a fraction of the cost of a SaaS product. 
Most of my experience comes form building mixed environment Grafana/Prometheus for metrics and Opensearch/Fluent-bit for logging 
pretty powerful and robust, but it can be simplified.



**Nice-to-haves**
**MacOS, Windows skills**
I've used MacOS in my last two jobs and manged Windows servers for SCADA system with MS SQL. Also, used Windows in other jobs, specially the earlier ones.

**Knowledge of GitHub/GitLab CI/CD**

Is really not that big of deal, everything you in a Linux box you can do it in remote executioner just have to give the 
right permissions to your infrastructure and  packages used. The key is to have good testing for stage of CICD peer review process. 
I would love to try Blue/Green or Canary deployment someday but no company I've worked for has gotten that far.

**Experience configuring L2/L3 network equipment**
So, I as electronic engineer we have a solid foundation in Networking models. I, particularly, did my Thesis building devices
that implemented an RS-485 over FHDSS (Frequency Hopping Direct Spread Spectrum) to interconnect industrial device over a master salve wireless network.
I got to program Atmel microcontroller in C/Assembler configuring the Transceiver interruption response routines.
I've physical switches and routers (Cisco), F5 Load Balancer, Linux Apache and Nginx reverse proxies and load balances, including different load balancing strategies like Cookies, sticky, MAC, IP.
Same for K8s port forwarding and ingress controller configuration.

**Your responsibilities**

**Managing Flipper Devices infrastructure and k8s**
Can't think of any better task than this.

**Improving infrastructure access control policies**
Policy is the security enforcer, together with configuration management are key to ensure a secure and reliable infrastructure, while limiting costs. 
I've configured policies in AWS, in Terraform, in Databricks and in Kubernetes (Services and Networking) and also in Linux, although they may have another name 

**Reviewing and improving deployment automation processes**


**Expanding existing monitoring systems**



**Building processes for regular infrastructure audits**


**Incident management**
