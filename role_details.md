Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer
Role Overview
We are seeking a Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer to lead the design, build, and operation of
scalable, secure, and reliable cloud infrastructure across AWS and Heroku. This role is
infrastructure-first: you will own cloud foundations, networking, automation, and operational
excellence while partnering closely with application and platform teams.
You will be expected to make pragmatic architectural decisions, lead hands-on implementation
efforts, improve reliability and cost efficiency, and raise the overall cloud maturity of the
organization across both IaaS and PaaS environments.
Key Responsibilities
● Design, implement, and operate cloud infrastructure supporting production workloads at
scale on AWS and Heroku
● Own core infrastructure components including networking, compute, storage, identity,
and connectivity across platforms
● Build and maintain infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform preferred;
CloudFormation acceptable where required)
● Design and operate AWS cloud networking (VPCs, routing, IP addressing, load
balancing, DNS, VPNs, private connectivity)
● Own and operate Heroku platform infrastructure, including dyno architecture, add-ons,
pipelines, buildpacks, runtime configuration, and environment promotion strategies
● Implement and manage container platforms and orchestration where appropriate (Docker,
Kubernetes)
● Partner with development teams to integrate infrastructure and Heroku platform
capabilities with application needs while minimizing developer friction
● Monitor, troubleshoot, and remediate infrastructure and platform issues across AWS and
Heroku; perform root cause analysis and drive long-term fixes
● Optimize cloud and platform environments for performance, availability, security, and
cost
● Implement security controls, access management, and compliance automation aligned
with company standards
● Contribute to incident response, on-call rotations, and operational readiness
● Define, document, and enforce infrastructure and platform best practices and standards
● Mentor engineers and provide technical leadership on cloud and platform engineering
topics

● Ensure infrastructure and platform usage aligns with compliance requirements (SOC 2,
ISO 27001, FedRAMP where applicable)
Required Qualifications
● 5+ years of hands-on experience building and operating cloud infrastructure in
production (AWS and/or Heroku)
● Strong experience managing large, distributed systems using Infrastructure as Code
● Deep understanding of AWS core services (EC2, VPC, ELB/ALB/NLB, S3, RDS, IAM,
Lambda)
● Strong hands-on experience operating applications and infrastructure on Heroku,
including pipelines, add-ons, scaling, runtime tuning, and production operations
● Strong operating system fundamentals and debugging skills
● Solid networking knowledge: routing, IP addressing, DNS, L4 vs L7 load balancing,
VPNs, traceroute
● Experience implementing private connectivity (e.g., AWS PrivateLink, VPC peering, or
equivalent)
● Proficiency with containers and orchestration platforms (Docker, Kubernetes)
● Experience with scripting and automation (Python, Bash, or similar)
● Proven ability to troubleshoot complex infrastructure, platform, and production issues
● Strong written and verbal communication skills
Preferred Qualifications
● Experience integrating Heroku with AWS services (databases, messaging, identity,
networking)
● Experience with CI/CD pipelines and platform automation workflows
● Familiarity with AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
● Experience operating data-intensive platforms (databases, ETL, analytics, ML platforms)
● AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer, or similar)
● Experience operating in regulated or compliance-driven environments
Core Skills
● AWS & Heroku
● Terraform / CloudFormation
● Kubernetes & Docker
● Linux
● Windows Server

● Networking & cloud security
● Python / scripting
● CI/CD pipelines
● Infrastructure & platform automation
● Prior experience in a Help Desk, IT Support, or IT Service Management (ITSM)
environment is highly valued.
